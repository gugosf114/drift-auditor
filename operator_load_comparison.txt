INTERPRETATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lowest operator load: ChatGPT (0.056 interventions/msg)
Highest operator load: Claude (0.082 interventions/msg)
Most self-sufficient: ChatGPT (72.1%)

Operator load ratio: Claude requires 1.5x more human effort
than ChatGPT to maintain alignment.

NOTE: Raw numbers are not directly comparable across models when the
operator uses different models for different task complexities. The
ratio of corrections to task complexity — normalized operator load —
is the metric that matters. This requires task-complexity annotation
which is not yet automated.
